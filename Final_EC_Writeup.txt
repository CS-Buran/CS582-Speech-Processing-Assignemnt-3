In this program I had to record 15 different clips of me pronouncing 1 to 10 in dothraki.
Afterwards I had to run the training program which in theory would recognize these numbers when pronounced.
I did the testing with only 1 more recorder pronounciations of  these numbers. The results were rather interesting.


Overall the program ran rather well, the red warning wall in the beginning as well as during testing was due
to me recording the sounds using the default audacity settings, but this did not have any effect on the program running.
What I found most interesting is the difficulty the program had while differentiating the sounds for one and two, "Ato" and "Akat".
There are two possible solutions to this problem:
a) Have a properly trained speaker of dothraki do the pronunciations
b) Have hundreds more samples from different people to train the program on

Both would be rather time consuming, however as all things, given enough time it is possible to get very good results.
